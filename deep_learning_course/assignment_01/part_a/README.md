# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Assignment #1 - Part 1

### Due Date:
- October 17, 2024, 11:59 PM

### Objective:
The objective of this project is to implement, train, and compare different machine learning (ML) algorithms that can efficiently detect heart disease. The dataset includes various features such as age, thalassemia, chest pain, preexisting conditions, and biological factors such as diabetes, obesity, unhealthy diet, excessive alcohol use, and physical inactivity.

### Machine Learning Algorithms to Implement:
1. **Logistic Regression (From Scratch)**
2. **Logistic Regression (Using a standard library)**
3. **Support Vector Machines (or any other ML algorithm of your choice)**

### Other Popular ML Algorithms for Comparison:
1. Simple Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machines
3. Artificial Neural Networks
4. Random Forest Classifier
5. K-Nearest Neighbors
6. Decision Tree Classifier

### Dataset:
The dataset for heart disease prediction should be downloaded from a trusted source or can be referenced from the following project for detailed information:

- [Heart Disease Prediction Project](https://www.projectpro.io/article/heart-disease-prediction-using-machine-learning-project/615#mcetoc_1g9uskd2k19)

### Problem Understanding:
Heart disease is influenced by several risk factors, such as diabetes, obesity, age, preexisting conditions, and lifestyle choices (unhealthy diet, alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity). Predicting heart disease involves leveraging these features using machine learning techniques to create accurate and reliable models.

[Heart Disease Prediction Research Paper](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=88650)

### Tasks:
1. **Logistic Regression from Scratch**: Implement a Logistic Regression algorithm from scratch using Python. No external libraries should be used, except for basic libraries like NumPy for matrix operations.
   
2. **Logistic Regression using a Standard Library**: Implement Logistic Regression using libraries like `sklearn` or any other standard ML library.

3. **Support Vector Machines (or an alternative)**: You can choose to implement Support Vector Machines (SVM) or any other machine learning algorithm (such as Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, etc.).

### Goals:
- Train and test models on the dataset.
- Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.).
- Compare the results of different models and discuss which one is best suited for heart disease prediction based on the dataset.

### Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix (for visualizing performance)

### Instructions:
1. Download the dataset and explore the features.
2. Implement the specified machine learning models.
3. Train and evaluate the models on the dataset.
4. Document the process, results, and comparisons in a report.
5. Submit the code and a summary of findings by the due date.

### Submission:
- **Code**: Provide well-documented Python code files for all implementations.
- **Report**: Submit a report summarizing your findings, comparisons, and results.
